							<p>Why does a weekly trip to the grocery store feel like a necessary evil? Stores are difficult to navigate, items are hard to find or forgotten, and waiting to check out is a pain. SmartCart attempted to tackle two major pain points in the grocery shopping experience: finding items and checking out.  </p>

						<p>Needfinding in this project began with talking with shoppers about supermarket frustrations, following their shopping habits, and talking with employees about self-checkout hassles and inefficiencies. After considering a number of prototypes, <a href='http://smartcart247.weebly.com/prototyping.html'>from Kinect to Leap Motion to capacitive sensing handlebars</a>, we decided on a tablet app.

						<hr class='indent' /><h3>User Testing</h3>
						<p> For user testing, we highlighted two main goals: <em>does SmartCart help users find what they need in grocery stores more efficiently?</em> and <em>does SmartCart make shopping less frustrating?</em> We invited participants to <a href='http://smartcart247.weebly.com/user-testing.html'>interact with SmartCart as if they were shopping regularly</a>. From tests, several interface issues were highlighted, but most prominent was the ambiguity found in checking out. Shoppers were reminded of an online experience, instead of a physical store. We added additional dialogues and more obvious actions to simplify the checkout process. </p>

						<p>Users highlighted a number of problems, ranging from cryptic system statuses to mismatches between the system and the real world. The next iteration included a number of features, such as <a href='http://smartcart247.weebly.com/functional-2.html'>adding autocomplete, resolving ambiguous items, and detailing checkout instructions</a>. Perhaps the biggest issue shoppers found was how difficult it was to use the SmartCart in coordination with a physical cart. The tablet seemed more like a peripheral accessory than an integrated component, so we designed a hardware enclosure to ease use and accessibility of the touchscreen.</p>
