					<h1>Shop Smarter</h1>
					<p>Why does a trip to Safeway feel like a necessary evil? Stores are maze-like, items are elusive or forgotten, and waiting to checkout is a pain. SmartCart tackled two major pain points in the grocery shopping experience: finding items and checking out.  </p>

					<h1>Shopping Styles</h1>
					<p>We observed a variety of shoppers at different Safeway locations in the surrounding Palo Alto. We found three common behaviors amongst shoppers: browsing, seeking, or (executing on) planning. These are not mutually exclusive, but rather shoppers frequently switch between modes.

					<h1>The Approach</h1>
					<p>We wanted to focus on reducing the hassles of finding items and checking out. Since grocery shopping is such a different yet universal chore, we hoped to design a solution that enhanced existing behaviors, without forcing a steep learning curve. The concept of SmartCart was born, a tablet app, used with existing grocery tools that everyone is familiar with – shopping carts.</p>

					<h1>Prototyping &amp; User Testing</h1>

					<h3>Shopping Modes</h3>

					<h3>Cart Mount</h3>

					<p>User testing revealed the tablet was really difficult to use by itself. There was a lot of switching eye gaze down and up. We designed a hardware enclosure out of plexiglass to ease use and accessibility of the touchscreen. We laser cut and assembled the enclosure and added it to the cart.

					<h1>Test</h1>

					<p>I prototyped the item-purchasing experience. Processing bar-coded items intended to use the rear-view camera to indicate a complete purchase. Produce became tricky. One concept used computer vision to determine the color of produce, wifi to narrow the list to produce within range, and then prompted the user to select from a shortlist the correctly scanned item by swiping through.</p>

				<div class="large-8 large-centered columns">
					<h1>User Testing, Part I</h1>
					<p> We Wizard-of-Oz'd two elements of SmartCart – the purchasing experience and the bookends of getting started with the cart and checking out. We held the Xoom tablet above a mock shopping cart (in this case, a laundry hamper) and observed participants interacting with our college groceries of ramen and oranges, the laundry basket, and our static mocks. </p>


					<h4>Checkout was different from other shopping experiences</h4>
					<p>Since all the items would be scanned and placed into the cart, we prototyped an Uber-like invisible confirmation. You could simply leave the store with your cart, your credit card charged, and everything complete. However, most people had no idea what to do after they had collected their items. When asked, they responded that they were looking for a shopping cart icon or some further instructions to "walk out the store". </p>

					<blockquote>
						Although people were shopping in a physical store, SmartCart reminded them of an online experience. 
					</blockquote>

					<h4>Scanning items should instill confidence</h4>
					<p>The common consensus was that the front camera was more intuitive of a scanning mechanism. We also heard people express worry about whether the camera was always on and always watching. We learned that lags created frustration, and lack of feedback in our Wizard of Oz skit was confusing. More importantly, the purchasing decision should install a sense of confidence. </p>

			<section id="proto2">
				<div class="large-8 large-centered columns">
					<h1>Prototyping, Part II</h1>

					<p>The first technical implementation focused on ease mapping shopping list items into the physical store, accommodating impulse buying, and scanning items with barcodes.</p>

<!-- 					<p>We tried scanning barcodes with both front and back cameras. The back camera was an awkward gesture, but the front camera was not sensitive enough to pick up barcodes correctly. We decided to try a handheld laser scanner. We were unsure how the interaction might feel, but would give us more insight in testing other flows.</p> -->

					<figure>
						<img src='images/smartcart/scanner.jpg' alt='Handheld laser scanner'>
						<figcaption>Since the front and back cameras seemed accurate or awkward, we started prototyping with a handheld laser scanner.</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>Our observations showed that people have widely different processes to go about grocery shopping. Some go into stores prepared with a list, but others are tend to buy impulsively. In order to accommodate those with mental lists, we used a QR code to reduce the friction from having a freeform list to getting the list onto SmartCart. </p>
					
					<!-- [qr code picture??] -->

				</div>
			</section>
			<section id="testing2">
				<div class="large-8 large-centered columns">
					<h1>User Testing, Part II</h1>
					<p>Prior to user testing, we added a handful of items to our item database and hard-coded their approximate locations in the Menlo Park Safeway. To simulate Wi-Fi localization, we set up a second tablet to control the cart's map position via Bluetooth. We came across two major issues, all related to the transition from the physical world to the digital SmartCart system. </p>

					<h4>Items had different mental models; some by brand, some by type</h4>
					<p>One of the questions we attempted to answer with our prototype was "what fidelity do people search for their groceries?" Some items had strong brand associations. For window cleaner, half the participants started typing "windex," but the Minute Maid Orange Juice was generalized to orange juice. In our redesign, we resolved ambiguous items so users could search either "chips" or "Doritos" using autocomplete. </p>

					<blockquote>
					Some items had strong brand attachment, like Windex. Others, like Minute Maid Orange Juice, were simply "orange juice."</blockquote>

					<h4>Checkout was still confusing</h4>
					<p>We added directions to tell participants to walk to the exit area, however people got there and still looked confused. Most surprising was that every single person expressed some sort of fear. These ranged from buying by accident, not paying for the right items, or the fear of being perceived as stealing something. Such a behavioral change was unnatural, and SmartCart should ease users through the journey. In our redesign, we acted out a receipt verification employee to check whether people's shopping carts matched their transactions.</p>

					    People were afraid of being perceived as stealing things.

					<h1>Prototyping, Part III</h1>

					<p>One of the conversations that constantly arose was whether SmartCart should be fully prescriptive and create an optimized grocery store route or maintain a casual attitude to let users find their own way around the store. Based on our initial observations around trust, we decided to let users find their own way around the store with some guidance without being intrusive.</p>

					<figure>

				<div class="large-8 large-centered columns">
				<h1>Key Takeaways</h1>
				<h4>Reach people where they are</h4>
				<p>Our prototype tried to eliminate the need to checkout by automatically charging credit cards. Some people might readily welcome changes like completely doing away with checkout, but others felt as if they were stealing things. Many iterations tried to ease people into the process – guidance to the exit, confirmation of payment and correct groceries. Reach people where they are with technology, don't coerce them into solutions. </p>

				<h4>Incorporate all stakeholders</h4>
				<p>Our prototype was a first attempt at meeting the needs of shoppers. However, interviews with store employees and managers revealed different needs – stocking inventory and preventing fraud. One story recalled how some underage teenagers scanned a sack of potatoes but then slipped through the self-checkout with a 6-pack of beer. These are critical concerns to address before understanding the value of SmartCart as a platform.</p>
